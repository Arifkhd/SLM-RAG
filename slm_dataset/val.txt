The establishment of reliable referral pathways from primary care facilities to secondary hospitals to dedicated cancer centres is the same approach as is required for the management of cervical cancer, lung cancer, colorectal cancer and prostate cancer. To that end, breast cancer is a so-called index disease whereby pathways are created that can be followed for the management of other cancers.

Causes and Risk Factors
Final Note - With early diagnosis and access to cutting-edge treatments like robotic surgery, proton therapy, and personalized immunotherapy, prostate cancer is among the most treatable cancers. Every case is different, and your treatment should be personalized by a urologist or oncology expert.
Infections from frequent hospital visits that involve central IVs.
In order to diagnose the presence of bacteria, the common tests prescribed are:
Uses sound waves to create images of the prostate. It is often used to guide biopsies.
Heart issues present at birth (congenital heart disease).
Difficulty starting or stopping urination
Dengue is spreading to new areas, including the European and Eastern Mediterranean regions. In 2024, 308 cases were reported to WHO from three European countries (France, Italy and Spain) and an additional 1291 cases and four deaths were recorded in the French overseas territories of Mayotte and Réunion.
Diagnosing drug-resistant forms of TB, including multidrug-resistant TB, as well as HIV-associated TB and pediatric TB can be complex. WHO recommends specific sample types, tests and strategies to detect these forms of TB to increase the chances of detecting disease early and accurately.
Prevention
Sexual dysfunction due to nerve and blood vessel damage, such as erectile dysfunction or vaginal dryness.
Common symptoms of gastroenteritis include diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Action can also be taken for individuals at particular risk:
heart attack, which occurs when the blood supply to the heart is blocked and heart muscle cells die from lack of oxygen. The longer the blood flow is blocked, the greater the damage to the heart;
clothes that cover as much of your body as possible;

The incidence of dengue has grown dramatically worldwide in recent decades, with the number of cases reported to WHO increasing from 505 430 cases in 2000 to 14.6 million in 2024. The vast majority of cases are asymptomatic or mild and self-managed, and hence the actual numbers of dengue cases are under-reported. The disease is now endemic in more than 100 countries.
The severity of symptoms can vary based on the type of diabetes you have. These symptoms are usually more intense in Type 1 diabetes than Type 2 diabetes.
Men aged 50 and above
Urinalysis. During this test, you’ll pee into a special cup. The provider will send the sample to a laboratory, where technicians will examine it for signs of a UTI using multiple variables such as nitrites, leukocyte esterase and white blood cells.
Management of breast cancer
There is no specific treatment for dengue, although pain can be managed with medication such as paracetamol (acetaminophen). Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines such as ibuprofen and aspirin should be avoided as they can increase the risk of bleeding.
2. Hematogenous (Bloodstream) Spread
The incidence of malignant melanoma in white populations generally increases with decreasing latitude, with the highest recorded incidence occurring in Australia, where the annual rates are 10 and over 20 times the rates in Europe for women and men respectively.

Even if your symptoms are mild, untreated ulcers can get worse. H. pylori can also lead to other problems, like stomach cancer.
In years past, surgery was an option to intentionally damage and scar a part of your brain that was malfunctioning because of Parkinson’s disease. Today, that same effect is possible using deep-brain stimulation, which uses an implanted device to deliver a mild electrical current to those same areas.
Common cold symptoms typically appear in stages. The common cold stages include early, active and late.
Reducing hypertension prevents heart attack, stroke and kidney damage, as well as other health problems.

Get regular checkups: Talk to your doctor about prostate health, especially after the age of 50 or earlier if you're in a high-risk group.
Swelling in the legs or pelvic area due to lymphatic obstruction
For adults:
Symptoms of these complications may include:
A diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats can reduce the risk of atherosclerosis and heart disease.
Rich or fatty foods.
Some symptoms may indicate a more serious problem. Contact your provider as soon as possible if you have common IBS symptoms alongside:
Why do children and babies get more colds?
Avoid excessive alcohol consumption: Drinking large amounts of alcohol can increase the risk of stomach cancer, especially in combination with smoking. Limiting alcohol intake to moderate levels or avoiding it altogether can help reduce risk.
NSAIDs overuse.
Washing your hands: Wash your hands frequently, especially before eating or preparing food. Also, wash your hands after using the bathroom, wiping your nose or coming into contact with someone who has a cold.
There may be more opportunities to participate in clinical trials the sooner you’re diagnosed.

Lymph Node Removal: Often, lymph nodes near the stomach are removed to check for cancer spread.
Your healthcare provider may prescribe medications to provide symptom relief, including:
As in the past decade, most of the spending on TB services in 2024 (82%) was from domestic sources. In absolute terms, Brazil, China, India, the Russian Federation and South Africa accounted for US$ 3.1 billion (64%) of the total of US$ 4.8 billion provided from domestic sources in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), international donor funding amounted to US$ 1.1 billion, having ranged from US$ 1.1 billion to US$ 1.2 billion in almost every year since 2015. Financing for TB research and innovation, at US$ 1.2 billion in 2023, also continues to fall far short of the global target of US$ 5 billion per year. Progress to date has been constrained by the overall level of investment.
Esophagitis. Esophagitis is inflammation in the lining of your esophagus. Chronic esophagitis can cause chronic pain and complications, like ulcers in your esophagus. After a long time, it can cause tissue changes like scarring or intestinal metaplasia, a precancerous condition.
To help manage acid reflux at home, try:
Neonatal diabetes: This is a rare form of diabetes that occurs within the first six months of life. It’s also a form of monogenic diabetes. About 50% of babies with neonatal diabetes have the lifelong form called permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus. For the other half, the condition disappears within a few months from onset, but it can come back later in life. This is called transient neonatal diabetes mellitus.
How are common colds in babies treated?
The prostate gland is part of the male reproductive system and is located below the bladder and in front of the rectum. It surrounds the urethra—the tube through which urine and semen exit the body.
It’s a good idea to wash your hands before and after going to the bathroom or having sex.
The health risks caused by overweight and obesity are increasingly well documented and understood.
Stable CAD: Gradual narrowing, manageable symptoms.
Hydralazine/nitrate combination if other treatments don’t stop your symptoms and you’re African American.
The symptoms of myocardial infarction can vary from person to person. While some individuals experience classic symptoms, others may have atypical signs. Recognizing the symptoms early can save lives, as prompt treatment is crucial to prevent further damage to the heart.
Most people with hypertension don’t feel any symptoms. Very high blood pressures can cause headaches, blurred vision, chest pain and other symptoms.
Diagnosis and Tests
When your brain sends activation signals that tell your muscles to move, it fine-tunes your movements using cells that require dopamine. That’s why lack of dopamine causes the slowed movements and tremors symptoms of Parkinson’s disease.
Complications
Each antiviral medication has different side effects, but common ones include nausea and diarrhea. Inhaled medications can cause spasms that tighten and narrow your airways (bronchospasm).
Over time, having consistently high blood glucose can cause health problems, such as heart disease, nerve damage and eye issues.

How much alcohol you drink.
Trouble swallowing (dysphagia). This happens with reduced throat muscle control. It increases the risk of problems like pneumonia or choking.
Common symptoms include:
Early treatment can prevent lung cancer from becoming worse and spreading to other parts of the body.
Family history of cardiomyopathy.
Altered mental status.
It is common to find undernutrition and obesity co-existing within the same country, the same community and the same household.
Triptans (5-hydroxytryptamine).
Contact with infected blood or bodily fluids is the main way these viruses spread. Without treatment, the viruses can lead to life-threatening liver disease. There are vaccines that help prevent some types of viral hepatitis.

Bronchopneumonia – Bronchopneumonia can damage portions of your lungs on both sides. It’s usually seen at or around your bronchi. The tubes that connect your windpipe to your lungs are known as bronchioles.
Practice good personal hygiene, like thorough handwashing with soap and water
Pneumonia
There is no official Stage 5 in prostate cancer staging. Stage 4 is the most advanced stage, and any further classification is based on specific metastasis sites or treatment response.
Chest pain.
Over-the-counter migraine medications are effective if you have mild to moderate migraine symptoms. The main ingredients in pain-relieving medications are ibuprofen, aspirin, acetaminophen, naproxen and caffeine.
Memory
Since the whole continuum of care is often complex, patient navigation helps streamline care pathways, improving health outcomes and patient satisfaction, and guiding individuals – especially in resource-limited or fragmented systems – through the cancer care continuum to ensure timely diagnosis and treatment completion. Benefits include increased screening rates, reduced hospital readmissions, better treatment understanding, and improved quality of life.
You get the infection after exposure to hepatitis viruses. These viruses are different but have some symptoms in common. Viral hepatitis may not cause symptoms right away. You can have and spread the condition without knowing you’re sick.
What tests will be done to diagnose congestive heart failure?
But certain, less common causes of gastroenteritis do need treatment. If your symptoms don’t seem to be going away, or you believe you have a type of toxic poisoning, tell a healthcare provider.
There are several types of diabetes. The most common forms include:
Lifestyle and Dietary Factors:
A red, irritated throat.
Runny nose.
In some cases, extensively drug-resistant TB or XDR-TB can develop. TB caused by bacteria that do not respond to the most effective drugs in MDR-TB treatment regimens can leave patients with very limited treatment options.
Hand washing is the most important way to reduce the spread of colds:
Sarcomas: Originate in the soft tissues or connective tissues of the prostate
Prevention of Myocardial Infarction
A Free PSA test may also be used. A low free PSA percentage suggests a higher risk of cancer.
Infectious/Environmental Causes:
Noncardiac chest pain. Some people feel pain in their esophagus that doesn’t feel like burning. Esophagus pain triggers the same nerves as heart-related pain does, so it might feel like that.
For example, when a person who’s sick sneezes or coughs, they launch droplets of fluid containing the cold virus into the air. If you breathe in those droplets, the cold virus takes root in your nose. You can also leave virus particles on surfaces you touch when you’re sick. If someone else touches those surfaces and then touches their nostrils, eyes or mouth, the virus can get in.
Treatment
Understanding the causes, symptoms, and risk factors of myocardial infarction is crucial for early detection and prevention. In this article, we will explore the definition of myocardial infarction, its causes, risk factors, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment options, and long-term outlook, providing valuable information for both patients and caregivers.
spasticity
Routine screening is advised for:
In addition, children are in close contact with other children. Kids typically don’t cover their coughs and sneezes or wash their hands before touching their faces — steps that prevent the virus from spreading.
Having a tough time picking something up
People with COPD also have a higher risk for other health problems. These include:
Asthma flare-up or difficulty breathing.
Over-the-counter (OTC) medicines for acid reflux include:
Hormonal changes or menstrual hormonal changes.
In certain countries, the Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine is given to babies or small children to prevent TB. The vaccine prevents deaths from TB and protects children from serious forms of TB.
blurred vision or other vision changes
What medications treat the flu?
Symptoms of Myocardial Infarction
Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH): This used to be known as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). It's the advanced stage of FLD and means you have inflammation in your liver. The inflammation and liver cell damage that happen with MASH can cause serious problems such as hepatic fibrosis and lead to cirrhosis, which are types of liver scarring, and liver cancer. These problems can lead to liver failure and require a liver transplant. NASH-related cirrhosis is already the leading indication for liver transplantation in women and those over 65 years of age. About 20% of people with MASLD have MASH.
What are the risk factors for congestive heart failure?
Having a heart attack.
Blank stare or a “staring into space.”
Gut bacteria: Research has shown that people with IBS may have altered bacteria in their GI tract, contributing to symptoms. Studies have shown that the types and amounts of gut bacteria are different in people with IBS than in people without it.
What is the life expectancy?
What are the types of diabetes?
Diabetes:
Antacids. Antacids (like Tums® and Rolaids®) neutralize your stomach acid so that when reflux happens, it isn’t as corrosive to your esophagus. They work well for occasional acid reflux, but they can have side effects if you take them too often, so they aren’t a good long-term solution.
light-coloured hair
Gastroenteritis symptoms often come on suddenly. Gastrointestinal symptoms appear first. You might have diarrhea, stomach pain or cramps, nausea and/or vomiting many times in a short period.
Pneumonia can progress and become life-threatening in some individuals. And hence, with medical assistance must be initiated as early as possible.
Physical activity strengthens the heart, lowers blood pressure, and helps maintain a healthy weight, reducing the risk of heart attack.
High Blood Pressure:
There’s no cure for a cold. You have to let it run its course. Most colds go away on their own within seven to 10 days and don’t turn into anything more serious. Common cold treatment includes over-the-counter (OTC) medications to help reduce your symptoms and keep you comfortable until you recover.
prolonged cough (sometimes with blood);
They might, but only if the cause goes away. If you have H. pylori or another condition, you’ll need treatment. Even if NSAIDs were the cause and you’ve stopped taking them, you should still get checked to rule out infection.
Dementia.
To lower your risk of stroke, eat a healthy diet (such as the Mediterranean diet), maintain a healthy weight and exercise regularly.
There isn’t a cure for IBS. But, most people manage symptoms by avoiding triggers and taking medications when necessary.
Scientists are always researching Alzheimer’s disease and possible treatments. Ask your provider if there are any clinical trials that could help you. Clinical trials are tests or research studies done using human volunteers who have a condition or issue. A trial might help you try new treatments that aren’t widely available yet.
Stop smoking
Hypertension.
Lubiprostone (Amitiza®).
Colon cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. In 2020, more than 1.9 million new cases of colorectal cancer and more than 930 000 deaths due to colorectal cancer were estimated to have occurred worldwide. Large geographical variations in incidence and mortality rates were observed. The incidence rates were highest in Europe and Australia and New Zealand, and the mortality rates were highest in Eastern Europe. By 2040 the burden of colorectal cancer will increase to 3.2 million new cases per year (an increase of 63%) and 1.6 million deaths per year (an increase of 73%).
Causes and Risk Factors
Levodopa metabolism inhibitors. These medications slow down how your body processes levodopa, helping it last longer. These medications may need careful use because they can have toxic effects and damage your liver. They’re most often used to help as levodopa becomes less effective.
Bad breath.
eating a healthy diet rich in fruits and vegetables
Use certain drugs or alcohol frequently.
Diuretics including hydrochlorothiazide and chlorthalidone eliminate extra water from the body, lowering blood pressure.
Influenza Tests
Wheezing.
Diarrhea.
Modifiable risk factors include unhealthy diets (excessive salt consumption, a diet high in saturated fat and trans fats, low intake of fruits and vegetables), physical inactivity, consumption of tobacco and alcohol, and being overweight or obese. In addition, there are environmental risk factors for hypertension and associated diseases, where air pollution is the most significant.
Constipation.
You’ll also have a physical exam. Your provider will look for signs of congestive heart failure and diseases that may have made your heart muscle weak or stiff.
Common symptoms of COPD develop from mid-life onwards. As COPD progresses, people find it more difficult to carry out their normal daily activities, often due to breathlessness. There may be a considerable financial burden due to limitation of workplace and home productivity, and costs of medical treatment.

Bacterial infections cause bacterial gastroenteritis. Common bacterial gastrointestinal infections include:
Focal onset impaired awareness seizure means you’re confused or have lost awareness or consciousness during the seizure. This seizure type used to be called complex partial seizure. Symptoms may include:
What are the four stages of congestive heart failure?
Exposure to bright lights, loud noises or strong odors.
chronic kidney disease
Safe travels. It’s especially easy to get food poisoning while traveling abroad. (This is called traveler’s diarrhea.) You may be exposed to microorganisms there that you wouldn’t meet at home. When traveling, it’s best to stick to cooked, peeled or packaged foods and bottled water.
What medications and treatments are used?
lipid-lowering therapy can be initiated for individuals at risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; and
Oxidative stress and chronic inflammation in the prostate
Peramivir (Rapivap®). Your provider gives you peramivir directly into your veins using an IV. You usually only need one dose of peramivir.
You should see a urologist or oncologist for further evaluation and screening, especially if:
Loud noises.
physiotherapy to improve mobility, muscle strength, balance, and coordination;
Symptoms
Type 2 diabetes and prediabetes: You may not have any symptoms at all, or you may not notice them since they develop slowly. Routine bloodwork may show a high blood sugar level before you recognize symptoms. Another possible sign of prediabetes is darkened skin on certain parts of your body (acanthosis nigricans).
Peptic Ulcer Disease – ulcers in stomach/duodenum
Quit smoking or vaping. This is the most important thing to do. Even if you have been smoking for many years, quitting can still help.
Summary: Early vs. Late-Stage Prostate Cancer
Blood tests.
Surgery is the primary treatment for early-stage stomach cancer, where the cancer is confined to the stomach or surrounding tissues. The types of surgery include:
Heart attack.
Sipuleucel-T (Provenge) – A personalized treatment designed for advanced cases
chest pain
Most peptic ulcers heal within a few weeks. Most people take medications for about two months. Treatment is usually effective, but people with chronic conditions may need long-term therapy.
Rare cases of transmission via blood products, organ donation and transfusions have been recorded. Similarly, transovarial transmission of the virus within mosquitoes has also been recorded.
A large number of atypical nevi (moles) is the strongest risk factor for malignant melanoma in fair-skinned populations.
Obesity
Keep appointments with your health care professional.
Medications
When this is the case, you need a more definitive treatment for acid reflux. This usually means a procedure to tighten your LES. These are minor, outpatient procedures, and they’re very effective.
Causes of Gastric (Stomach) Cancer
Angioplasty and Stenting:
There isn’t a cure for migraines. But a healthcare provider can help you manage migraine symptoms through the following:
Being overweight in childhood and adolescence affects children’s and adolescents’ health and is associated with greater risk and earlier onset of various NCDs,
Sudden, sharp stomach pain
Access to inhalers is a problem in many countries. In 2021, bronchodilators were available in public primary health care facilities in half of low- and low-middle income countries, and steroid inhalers available in one third.
Cardiac rehabilitation programs involve supervised exercise, education, and counseling to help individuals recover from a heart attack and improve cardiovascular health.
The economic impacts of the obesity epidemic are also important. If nothing is done, the global costs of overweight and obesity are predicted to reach US$ 3 trillion per year by 2030 and more than US$ 18 trillion by 2060 (4).
High blood pressure.
Slowed movements (bradykinesia). A Parkinson’s disease diagnosis requires that you have this symptom. People who have this describe it as muscle weakness, but it happens because of muscle control problems, and there’s no actual loss of strength.
Periods: You may notice symptoms worsen predictability according to your menstrual cycle.
How Prostate Cancer Spreads in the Body
Stress: Some researchers suggest that IBS is your gut’s response to stress. Related, this is why IBS is sometimes called “nervous stomach” or “anxious stomach.”
Removing scar tissue or opening a blocked stomach outlet (pyloroplasty)
Nissen fundoplication. Fundoplication is the most common surgery for GERD. When possible, it’s done as a laparoscopic surgery, which means smaller incisions and less recovery time. A surgeon wraps the top of your stomach around your lower esophagus and secures it with stitches to tighten the junction between them. This is also the procedure to fix a hiatal hernia.
assessment for carotid artery stenosis can be carried out and when clinically indicated, revascularization (a medical procedure aimed at restoring the blood flow to the brain when the flow is limited or there is a blockage, as in ischemic stroke) can be considered.
You may have an increased risk of developing a UTI if you use a diaphragm for birth control. Talk to a healthcare provider about other birth control options.
Physical activity.
Difficulty speaking or concentrating.
Excessive Alcohol Consumption:
Previous Stomach Surgery: People who have had stomach surgery, such as partial gastrectomy, for ulcers or other medical reasons, may have an increased risk of stomach cancer later in life. The changes in the stomach after surgery can sometimes promote cancerous growth.
Why can’t antibiotics cure a cold?
Most people with dengue have mild or no symptoms and will get better in 1–2 weeks. Rarely, dengue can be severe and lead to death.
The prognosis (outlook) for diabetes varies greatly depending on several factors, including:
The following test results typically indicate if you don’t have diabetes, have prediabetes or have diabetes. These values may vary slightly. In addition, healthcare providers rely on more than one test to diagnose diabetes.
To screen for and diagnose gestational diabetes, providers order an oral glucose tolerance test.
The influenza virus causes flu. Influenza A, B and C are the most common types that infect people. Influenza A and B are seasonal (most people get them in the winter) and have more severe symptoms. Influenza C doesn’t cause severe symptoms and it’s not seasonal — the number of cases stays about the same throughout the year.
Heart palpitations.
Improving comfort and quality of life
Get extra rest so your body has energy to fight off or cope with viral hepatitis.
Producing seminal fluid that supports and transports sperm
Medications that may relieve cold symptoms include:
Has there been a change in how your poop looks?
a breast lump or thickening, often without pain
Some inhalers open the airways and may be given regularly to prevent or reduce symptoms, and to relieve symptoms during acute flare-ups. Inhaled corticosteroids are sometimes given in combination with these to reduce inflammation in the lungs.
Can epilepsy be prevented?
Who is at the greatest risk of getting a urinary tract infection?
Stem cell transplants. These add new dopamine-using neurons into your brain to take over for damaged ones.
It is often not causing symptoms and may be detected through routine PSA screening or biopsy.
No alcohol or recreational drugs.
Diagnosis for Gastric (Stomach) Cancer
Up to 70% of people with peptic ulcer disease don’t notice symptoms. But the most common ones are central upper abdominal pain (epigastric pain) and indigestion. Indigestion often happens after eating and feels like a burning or gnawing sensation.
Other relevant vaccines include influenza vaccine, chicken pox vaccine, MMR
Duodenal ulcers account for almost 80% of peptic ulcers.
Get enough sleep. Aim for seven to nine hours of quality sleep each night. Go to bed at the same time each night. A good night’s rest is one of the most powerful de-stressors available. Reach out to a provider if you’re having trouble sleeping.
After primary treatment (surgery, radiation, etc.), regular PSA tests, imaging scans, and clinical check-ups are essential for early detection of recurrence. Early intervention may help manage recurrence effectively and improve quality of life.
The biggest complication of Alzheimer’s disease is the damage it does to your brain. That can cause permanent changes to your ability to think, to use your body and to your personality. As the condition progresses, you’re likely to experience complications, some of which can be fatal.
Most of the time, gastroenteritis is brief and ends by itself. When this is the case, the primary complication to look out for is dehydration. This is more of a risk for children and senior citizens.
Sensitivity to light and sound.

When it comes to stomach cancer, knowing the do's and don'ts can make a significant difference in managing the condition and improving overall health. By following these guidelines, individuals can take proactive steps to support their well-being and potentially reduce the risk of complications.
Treatments for Stage A.
Toast.
In most cases, gastroenteritis goes away by itself. The best way to help your body recover is to give it lots of rest and fluids. You might want to stick with bland, easy-to-digest foods for a few days.
Antiseizure medications (valproic acid, topiramate).
Because some anti-seizure medications are linked to birth defects, let your healthcare provider know if you’re pregnant or planning to become pregnant.
Red meat.
Kidney stones may pass out of the body naturally through urine, but larger stones can cause significant pain and complications. The condition can affect people of any age and is more common in individuals who do not drink enough fluids or have certain dietary and metabolic risk factors.
Diabetes.
General health.
Aspiration pneumonia – Aspiration pneumonia is caused by inhaling microorganisms from food, drink, or saliva into your lungs. If you have a swallowing difficulty or are excessively sedated from the use of medications, alcohol, or other drugs, it’s more likely to happen.
Having a traumatic brain injury
Children in low- and middle-income countries are more vulnerable to inadequate pre-natal, infant, and young child nutrition. At the same time, these children are exposed to high-fat, high-sugar, high-salt, energy-dense, and micronutrient-poor foods, which tend to be lower in cost but also lower in nutrient quality. These dietary patterns, in conjunction with lower levels of physical activity, result in sharp increases in childhood obesity while undernutrition issues remain unsolved.
Dietary changes.
Addictive substances like caffeine or tobacco.
Risk Factors of Gastric (Stomach) Cancer
Hypertension (high blood pressure) is one of the most important risk factors for myocardial infarction. High blood pressure damages the arteries, making them more susceptible to plaque buildup and leading to coronary artery disease.
Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS): This complication mainly affects people with Type 2 diabetes. It happens when your blood sugar levels are very high (over 600 milligrams per deciliter or mg/dL) for a long period, leading to severe dehydration and confusion. It requires immediate medical treatment.
Experts have linked at least seven different genes to Parkinson’s disease. They’ve linked three of those to early onset of the condition (meaning at a younger-than-usual age). Some genetic mutations also cause unique, distinguishing features.
Medications
Changes in your emotions.
If you think you have the flu, it’s important to get tested early on so that antiviral medications are most effective if your provider prescribes them. Contact a healthcare provider right away if:
But if you have chronic acid reflux or GERD, they also recommend medicines to reduce your stomach acid, so reflux is less damaging. These medicines are easily available and highly effective for GERD.
When can I go back to work/school?
GERD symptoms may be worse:
Hypertension
Cocaine.
Eat a healthy diet, such as the Mediterranean diet.
